Today the Linux Foundation announced a [new holiday promotion](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/join/individual/get-one-give-one-promotion). For every new individual member who joins ($99/year), the Linux Foundation will also give a free membership to a student.

> By joining the Linux Foundation, members help support the work of Linus Torvalds, as well as programs that promote and protect Linux. Members have access to exclusive benefits, including a Linux.com email address (ex: joe@linux.com); a Linux Foundation t-shirt; employee purchase pricing at Dell, HP, and Lenovo with savings up to 40% on purchases of hardware and accessories; 35% off O'Reilly books and e-books; a variety of deep discounts to attend events or subscribe to industry publications; and the ability to run for a Linux Foundation board seat, among others. With all these perks, the membership can quickly pay for itself. Here is the full press release:

>SAN FRANCISCO, December 9, 2009, The Linux Foundation (LF), the nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux, today announced that for every new individual member who joins the organization between today and January 31, 2010, the Linux Foundation will give a free membership to a student for one year.

>New members can elect to sponsor a student on the Linux Foundation wait list or can request the membership be given to a friend or family member with a valid student ID. Students who are interested in obtaining a sponsored membership can sign up at the Linux Foundation website and will be sponsored on a first-come, first-served basis. Proof of student status must be provided. Details can be found at the website:www.linuxfoundation.org/about/join/individual/get-one-give-one-promotion

>Individual members are the heartbeat of the Linux Foundation, and students bring to the table new ideas and energy required to advance Linux into a new decade,â€ said Jim Zemlin, executive director at the Linux Foundation. New members who join during our holiday program will get the additional benefit of contributing to the advancement of Linux by bringing the next-generation of architects, maintainers and experts into the community.
