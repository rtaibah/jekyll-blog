Last week I [reported](/2008/02/25/photobucket-blocked-in-ksa) that Saudi Arabia has blocked [photobucket](http://photobucket.com) for some peculiar reason. This censorship coincided with Pakistan's blocking of youtube. Anyhow I am happy to inform you that [photobucket](http://photobucket.com) was unblocked today. Did my E-mail resonate with the authorities? I really don't know. I would like to think so! But in any case I am sure am not the only one escalated the issue.
