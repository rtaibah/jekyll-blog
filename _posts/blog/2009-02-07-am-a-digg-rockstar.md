One of my favorite Linux and Open Source blogs is CNET's [Matt Asay](http://twitter.com/mjasay) [Open Road](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10154053-16.html?part=rss) blog. I frequently submit Matt's stuff to Digg and diggers seem to love his stuff. A lot of his posts got popular and Matt took notice. So he decided to reach out and show his appreciation and thank me. For a minute there I was star-struck (really am not kidding!). We further exchanged E-mails, and the conversation steered to Digg and what makes it click. 

Matt liked what I had to say about Digg, and decided to post a blog about it, and I got me [my first interview ever](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10158257-16.html?tag=mncol;title)! AND its on CNET! AND he called me a **ROCKSTAR**.


Yeah am that cool!
