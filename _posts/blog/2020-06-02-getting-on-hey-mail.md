I am a big fan of [dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh) and the work he does at Basecamp. Recently he announced a new product that will supposedly make us fall again in love with email. It' s not launched yet, but one can get an early invite by sharing with them your story with email:

> To get on the list, email iwant@hey.com and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate story. Could be long, could be short. It’s your story, so it’s up to you. Invites will begin going out June 15th, 2020.

As a teenager living in mid-90's Saudi Arabia, my attempt was a play on the [boy from Nantucket limerick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_once_was_a_man_from_Nantucket):

> There was once a boy from where girls were off limit
>
> Who wished to fly to America on a rocket
>
> But his email helped him find a girl named Jan
>
> Wrote to her as much as he can
>
> And as for the rocket, fuck it
