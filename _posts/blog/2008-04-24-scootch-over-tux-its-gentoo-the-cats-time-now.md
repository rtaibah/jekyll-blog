In a recent blog post of mine, [Etymology of A Distro](/2008/04/06/etymology-of-a-distro), I mentioned that I convinced a friend to name her cat "Gentoo". And since we all know that the Internet is basically built on [tubes and cat pictures](http://mixxingbowl.com/2008/03/20/social-mediacrity-the-plan/), I decided to treat it as a dump truck and load all the Gentoo The Cat pictures! Watch out, your "internets" will get delayed by a few more seconds.

Oh while we're at it, these pictures will be sooner or later be featured in a LOLcats design somewhere, so please do share them with me :)

Last but not least, Gentoo as usual pissing on a Windows machine. He developed a hobby, good for him :)
