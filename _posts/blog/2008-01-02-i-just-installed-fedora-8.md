summary: I just finished from setting up [Fedora 8](http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f8/en_US/) on my system. My last experience with a [Red Hat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) distro dates back to the days of [Fedora Core 5](http://www.redhat.com/magazine/018apr06/features/fc5_overview/) which only lasted for a couple of days. I must confess I was hesitant to install F8, as I have grown a disliking of [Red Hat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux) based distros. F8 is about to change that!

I will write a full review when I get the chance to fully test out the system, for the time being, here are some Uber cool screen shots:
