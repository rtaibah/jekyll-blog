Today, I lead a cryptography basics session at [Jeddah Science Society](http://thesciencesociety.com/). We started with the basics of a [Caesar ciphers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) and built up from there to how stream ciphers work. The topics covered:

  * Caesar ciphers
  * Letter and pair frequency analysis
  * Cryptographic wheel mechanism and demo
  * Demonstrated a true mechanical random number generator with ping pong balls
  * History and applications of one time pads
  * Logical gates (AND, OR, XOR)
  * XORing actual data for encryption

We wrapped up the session talking about miscellaneous crypto topics such as Heartbleed and Tor.
