summary: During my [interview with LinEx developer Daniel Campos](/2008/02/07/an-interview-with-an-extremadura-developer-bringing-linux-to-the-masses), Daniel shared with me this picture. I found it hillarious, and decided to give it a post on it's own. It's basically a picture of two Windows Live chicks losing their virginity at a Linux conference held Spain !:D
