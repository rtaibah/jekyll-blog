During my [interview with LinEx developer Daniel Campos](/2008/02/07/an-interview-with-spanish-region-extremadura-linux-developer), Daniel shared with me this picture. I found it hillarious, and decided to give it a post on it's own. It's basically a picture of two Windows Live chicks losing their virginity at a Linux conference held Spain !:D


A captioning contest for this would totally kick ass!! [Click here](/2008/02/15/caption-this-and-win) for more details.
