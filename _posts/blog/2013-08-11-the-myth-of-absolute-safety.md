In Saudi Arabia, there is a widespread belief that the country enjoys what someone might describe as &#8220;absolute safety.&#8221; That the country is a sanctuary with almost non-existent crime rates. I found this interesting graph in Stephen Pinker&#8217;s The Better Angels of Our Nature (great book; highly recommended!)

Its not that bad, but its not great either. Basically middle of the road, not exactly a haven. To put this in context, a 3-5/100,000 annual homicide rate basically translates to: the probability of you knowing someone getting murdered in your lifetime is a flip of a coin (50-50)
