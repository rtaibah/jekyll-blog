Linus had a talk at Aalto University recently, and the talk is making the rounds on the Interwebs. Linus talked about the beginning of Linux, and his motivation behind coding it in the first place. He then started taking questions from students; when asked about all the issues Linux users face with NVidia graphic cards, he gave us a sweet F bomb and a finger.

I concur.

Interestingly, the last question came from a guy who just joined NVidia to do opensource work there. “[Even though you gave me the finger, I still thank you!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=MShbP3OpASA#t=3630s)”

To which he replied:

> “I actually like being outragous at times, its amusing, I guarantee you if you make that video available on the Internet, there will be thousands of people really upset. I like offending people, because I think people who get offended should be offended"
