Check out how I manage all my micro-blogging activities. This works for me thus far, I am sure there are more ways to enhance it, am still exploring.

Currently I have two active Twitter accounts; one for my personal use [@bianconeri4ever ](http://www.twitter.com/bianconeri4ever) and the other for my Linux blog [@royal_linuxing](http://www.twitter.com/royal_linuxing):

- I use [Tweetdeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com) for my main account, with columns of all my incoming tweets, replies, and direct links to popular Digg stories using a Twitter bot I made [@diggfeeder](http://www.twitter.com/diggfeeder).  Also if you scroll a bit to the right, there is a [Twitscoop](http://www.twitscoop.com/) cloud, and a tweets that I don't wanna miss from close friends and/or interesting tweeple

- I use [Twhirl](http://twhirl.org) for my Linux blog [@royal_linuxing](http://www.twitter.com/royal_linuxing). Since my blog is niche, all the people I follow will be Linux fans/lovers, so am always reading their tweets, I don't really need to filter them, as I do with my main account

- [Ping.fm](http://ping.fm) IM bot on the bottom right. Over there I update my status on multiple different social networks: [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/bianconeri4ever), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=530835351&ref=profile), [Plurk](http://www.plurk.com/bianconeri4ever), [Tumblr](http://bianconeri4ever.tumblr.com), [Identi.ca](http://identi.ca/bianconeri4ever), [Brightkite](http://brightkite.com/people/bianconeri4ever), and [Fickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/22663008@N04/)

Of course I have the luxury of doing this because unlike some unnamed popular Operating System, I have more than one desktop! Browsing, micro-blogging, Chatting/IM, torrenting/multimedia…in that same exact order.
