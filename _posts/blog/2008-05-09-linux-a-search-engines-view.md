In May's issue of [Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com), their segment "LJ Index" featured some tidbits or trends about which countries are actually Googling "Linux." It is always interesting where Linux is gaining public interest, which countries are falling behind. (Source: [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends))


* **Russia** claimed the top spot
* **India** came in second
* Number of Asian countries in the top ten: **3**
* Number of European countries in the top ten: **7**
* Number of North American countries in the top ten:
* Position of Russian among all languages: 1

I then decided to play around with Google trends on my own, here are some interesting results:

Recently, the two terms "Ubuntu" and "Linux" became almost at par:

Norway leads in searching "Ubuntu":

Over the years "Microsoft" and "Linux" are almost at par; with a slight edge for Microsoft since 2005:

Ubuntu is trailing behind Mac and Vista:
