<blockquote>
<p>Sony Ericsson has unveiled the release date for its first-ever Android device – the Sony Xperia X10.</p>
<p>Expected to hit stores 10 February 2010 – <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/sony-ericsson-unveils-the-android-xperia-x10-646383">as predicted by TechRadar earlier this month</a> – the Xperia X10 is certainly well-equipped for Google's OS.</p>
<p>Sporting a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, it will be the speediest Android-infused handset on the market and one which is also packed with some mouth-watering features.</p>
<h4>Feature focus</h4>
<p>These include an LED Flash – which will hopefully follow in the HTC HD2's footsteps and be as bright as the sun – automatic face-tagging, an 8MP camera and a 4-inch WVGA screen.</p>
<p>Oh, and it will be packing Android 2.0, so expect Google Navigation and the like.</p>
<p>Couple this with a 3.5mm headphone jack and a new overlay which will give user a new way to search on the phone, and it sounds like Sony has come up with a real contender in the burgeoning Android market-place.</p>

This might cancel my Droid plans. Always been a fan of SonyEricsson before Android coming to the scene. Is this a perfect marriage?
  
Wish it had a physical keyboard though….
