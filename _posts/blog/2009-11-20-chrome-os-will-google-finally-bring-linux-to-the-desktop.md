<blockquote>
Google stole the tech and media spotlight today as it revealed a mountain of new details about Chrome OS, the company's new operating system due in late 2010. It is a completely different type of OS (we provide a summary of how) that eliminates the desktop and focuses on getting you on the web quickly and efficiently.

Maybe. Maybe not. Though I have concerns of Google owning everything now. Imagine this project succeeds and millions upon millions have their data in Google&#8217;s cloud. They already have a huge amount of data on most of us, throw in all my activity on an OS, and you got a new and very frightening hegemony.

In any case, I welcome anything that would take away from the *other* hegemony ðŸ™‚
