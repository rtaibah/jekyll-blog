Half way through the year I decided to keep hehe2.net a Linux and Open Source blog. But this kinda raised a problem: With my vast knowledge in every F'ing field I am bound to have something to share with this world. So I decided to install WordPress as a subdomain to my [lifestream](http://ramitaibah.com) (ramitaibah.com)."
