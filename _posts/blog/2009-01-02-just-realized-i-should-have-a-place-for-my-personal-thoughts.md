Its been a year since I started blogging at [hehe2.net](http://hehe2.net). Over there I usually write about Linux and Open Source, one of the greatest passions in my life. Half way through the year I decided to keep hehe2.net a Linux and Open Source blog. But this kinda raised a problem: With my vast knowledge in every F'ing field I am bound to have something to share with this world. So I decided to install WordPress as a subdomain to my [lifestream](http://ramitaibah.com) (ramitaibah.com).

Stay tuned here for my latest news, rants, and wisdom-ness.
