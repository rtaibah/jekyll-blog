summary: I mean it casts doubt in your heart, there is a tiny possibility that anything you read or hear is a total bullocks! The whole intertubes just turns into one big circus! I don't know what this is, either Digg went apeshit or another Fools Day joke :S. Hell even this might be "shopped" ;)

I mean it casts doubt in your heart, there is a tiny possibility that anything you read or hear is a total bullocks! The whole intertubes just turns into one big circus! I don't know what this is, either Digg went apeshit or another Fools Day joke :S. Hell even this might be "shopped" ;)

_Edit: Apparently I wasn't paying much attention the top ten stories on Digg. The [most popular Digg story](http://bendosphere.blogspot.com/2008/04/diggs-april-fools-day-joke.html) as we speak explains it. This happens after you digg a story and part of their April Fool ass-hattery. You get a random symbol everytime you digg a story._
