<h3><p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p></h3>

<strong><p>Iâ€™m Rami. A football loving, outdoorsy, open source advocate, UX designer & UI engineer.<p></strong>

<p>This is a website that is a culmination of over of a decade of blogging & social media (over)sharing. Where I will try to funnel all my past online activity into this site.</p>

<p>Instagram & Path images go into <a href="/lifestream">Lifestream</a>.  Blogposts written for different blogs (3 in total) go into <a href="/blog">blogs</a>. Location checkins go into, you guessed it <a href="/checkins">checkins</a>. <a href="/books">Books</a> contain a summaries of books I read. <a href="/notes">Notes</a> for my tweets. And <a href="/zeitgeist">Web Zeitgeist</a> contain memes, images, and videos I shared (but not mine) over the years.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this will take some time. Slowly but surely I will be working through this endeavour.</p>

<h3>Tools currently being used</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Jekyll</li>
  <li>vim</li>
  <li>Various Wordpress exporters</li>
  <li>Some scripts (available on github) to scrape data</li>
</ul>
